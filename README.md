# Entropy Web

Entropy on the web.

## What's inside?

This turborepo uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) as a package manager. It includes the following packages & apps:

### Apps and Packages

- `docs`: app documenting our DSL ([Next.js](https://nextjs.org/))
- `entropy-plus`: the entropy+ platform ([Next.js](https://nextjs.org/))
- `dsl`: a Design System Language consisting of React components shared by both `entropy-plus` and `docs`
- `eslint-config-custom`: `eslint` configurations (includes `eslint-config-next` and `eslint-config-prettier`)
- `tsconfig`: `tsconfig.json`s used throughout the monorepo

### Utilities

This turborepo has some additional tools already setup for you:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for static type checking
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for code linting
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io) for code formatting

### Build

To build all apps and packages, run:

```
pnpm run build
```

### Develop

To develop all apps and packages, run:

```
pnpm run dev
```

### Creating DSL components

When creating new DSL components, to get some boilerplate code up, run:

```
pnpm plop
```

### Remote Caching

Turborepo can use a technique known as [Remote Caching](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/core-concepts/remote-caching) to share cache artifacts across machines, enabling you to share build caches with your team and CI/CD pipelines.

By default, Turborepo will cache locally. To enable Remote Caching you will need an account with Vercel. If you don't have an account you can [create one](https://vercel.com/signup), then enter the following commands:

```
pnpm dlx turbo login
```

This will authenticate the Turborepo CLI with your [Vercel account](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/personal-accounts/overview).

Next, you can link your Turborepo to your Remote Cache by running the following command from the root of your turborepo:

```
pnpm dlx turbo link
```
